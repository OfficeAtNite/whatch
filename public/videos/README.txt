This directory should contain a video file named cinema-background.mp4 for the background of the application.

For development purposes, you can use a placeholder video or download a royalty-free cinematic background video.

Suggested sources for royalty-free videos:
- Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/videos/)
- Pixabay (https://pixabay.com/videos/)
- Videvo (https://www.videvo.net/)

Look for terms like "cinema", "movie theater", "film", or "projector" to find appropriate background videos.
